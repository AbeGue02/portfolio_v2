                    I was born in the vibrant state of Zulia, Venezuela, back in 2002, surrounded by the rich culture and beauty of my homeland. However, in 2014, my family faced the harsh realities of our country's challenges, prompting us to seek a new beginning in the United States. Faced with the daunting task of starting afresh in a foreign land, my parents made the courageous decision to uproot our lives for the sake of our future.

                    Our transition to the United States was anything but easy. Adapting to a new way of life in a country where we didn't speak the language presented countless obstacles for my family. My sister and I found ourselves navigating unfamiliar territory, grappling with the upheaval of our entire existence, including the daunting task of acclimating to school without a grasp of the English language. Despite the hardships, we persevered, slowly but surely adjusting to our new reality.

                As I journeyed through high school, I embarked on a deeply personal discoveryâ€”I came to terms with my identity as a gay individual. The prospect of revealing this truth to my conservative, Catholic, Latinx family filled me with apprehension. Wrestling with the decision to come out consumed me throughout my high school years. It wasn't until two years post-graduation that I summoned the courage to have open and understanding conversations with my family. To my relief and joy, I was met with acceptance and love, marking a profound milestone in my personal journey.
